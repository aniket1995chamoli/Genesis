# AngularPlayPen

This project is created to play around with the various concepts covered in angular.io

* The basic project structure is that each section of the angular.io is implemented as a component here.
* So a tab like 'Main Concept' is a component here. Such parent tabs are kept in 'main' module.
* Under 'Main Concept' there are further parent topics like 'Component', 'Templates' etc. These are also all implemented as components and kept together in 'sub' module.
* Finally there are the leaf tab are the actual concepts themselves such as 'Input','Pipes' etc. These are implemented as components and grouped in the moduel 'topic'.
* Basic url routing is done.
* Also this lacks any proper css what-so-ever. That would be handled (if it is even possible) at the end when all concepts have been covered. 
* The main aim to check out all basic concepts explored in angular.io
